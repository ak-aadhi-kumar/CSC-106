# Algorithm
1. Input original price of item
2. Input sale percent
3. Input coupon percent
4. `sale price = original price * (1 - sale percent)`
5. `final price = sale price * (1 - coupon percent)`

# Data example
1. Original price = 10 USD
2. Sale percent = 5%
3. Coupon percent = 10%
4. sale price = 9.50 USD
5. final price = 8.55 USD
