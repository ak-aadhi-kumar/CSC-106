# Algorithm
1. Initialise sum variable
2. 5-round loop
    1. Input grade
    2. Convert grade to number
    3. Add grade to sum
3. Inplace divide by 5
4. Display sum variable

# Data example
1. Input 100
2. Sum = 100
3. Input 90
4. Sum = 190
5. Input 30
6. Sum = 220
7. Input 70
8. Sum = 290
9. Input 0
10. Sum = 290
11. (Inplace division) Sum = 58.0
12. Display "58.0"
