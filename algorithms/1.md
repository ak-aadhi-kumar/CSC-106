# Algorithm
1. Input odometer reading before gas
2. Input odometer reading after gas
3. Input gallons of gas purchased
4. `mpg = (after gas - before gas)/gallons purchased`
5. Display distance (calculate by `after gas - before gas`)
6. Display mpg

# Data example
1. Before gas = 1000
2. After gas = 1500
3. Gas purchased = 20 gallons
4. mpg = 25
5. Distance: 400 miles
6. Average mpg = 25
