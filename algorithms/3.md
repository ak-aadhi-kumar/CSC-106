# Algorithm
1. Input room length
2. Input room width
3. Input room height
4. `Ceiling paint area = room length * room width`
5. `Wall paint area = 2 * room height * room length + 2 * room width * room height`
6. Display wall paint area
7. Display ceiling paint area
8. If ceiling paint area > wall paint area, then
    Diplay "Ceiling is larger"
(The above is actually mathematically impossible for rectangular rooms, so I normally wouldn't bother programming it in at all)
9. Else if wall paint area > ceiling paint area, then
    Display "Wall area is larger"
(The above will actually be mathemtaically always true for rectangular rooms)

# Data example
1. Room length = 45 ft
2. Room width = 15 ft
3. Room height = 9 ft
4. Ceiling paint area = 675 sqft
5. Wall paint area = 1080 sqft
6. Display "Ceiling paint area = 675 sqft"
7. Display "Wall paint area = 1080 sqft"
8. Display "Wall area is larger"
